# Week 4 : API

This week, we explored REST API calls involving HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

## REST API

REST - (Representational State Transfer) relies primarily on a stateless, client-server protocol and utilizes HTTP as its underlying communication protocol.

API - (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other, enabling them to exchange data and functionalities.

## Endpoints

These are the URIs/URLs where APIs or servers can be accessed by a client application. The endpoints can be public (free) or require an access token or API key for authentication.

## HTTP Methods

These methods include:

- GET - This method is used to retrieve data from a server.
- POST - This method is used to submit data to a server to create a new resource.
- PUT - This method is used to update a specified resource on the server.
- DELETE - This method is used to delete a specific resource from the server.
